# ZipCodes 
ZipCodes is a small application composed of a simple Aspnet web api as backend and a simple react app as the frontend.

## How it works 
Users can search for a zip code and data will be fetch from an external API (zippopotamus). After searching for some valid zip code, data will be added to a database of known zip codes. This will allow to search those stored zip codes by city or find the most searched zip codes.

## How to setup
You can open each application by accessing Frontend or Backend folder and follow each instructions in each respective Readme file that contains instructions on how to run app in development mode or using docker compose.
